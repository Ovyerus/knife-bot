Simple, open-source moderation bot for Discord.

## Features
- Configurable auto-moderation of mass mentions and server invites.
- Robust purge commands.
- Memes.

The bot requires a `config.json` in the same directory as `bot.js` in order to function. This contains settings such as the bot's token and owner ID.
I will not be providing an example for this, so you will need to read the code in order to find out what you need?
